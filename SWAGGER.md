# Swagger Usage

Swagger UI is enabled in all environments.

After running the API you can access the interactive documentation at:

```
http://localhost:{port}/swagger
```

Replace `{port}` with the port number the application is listening on. For typical `dotnet run` defaults this is `https://localhost:5001/swagger` or `http://localhost:5000/swagger`.

Use this URL to explore and interact with the available API endpoints.
